## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

The filter function

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```js
datas.filter((data) => {
  for (let key of filterList) {
    if (
      data.role !== key &&
      data.level !== key &&
      !data.languages.includes(key) &&
      !data.tools.includes(key)
    ) {
      return false;
    }
  }
  return true;
});
```
